      "This means that you can easily create any design that you could print onto paper. You can use many colors, create complex graphics, or even use photos. The ink soaks into the fabric of the shirt somewhat, meaning that the design feels soft to the touch instead of forming a stiff layer on top of the fabric. Another advantage of this method is that you can quickly run off one design after another without any complex setup.",

      "Heat press printing is a good option for a beginner or at-home artist, though it typically does not offer the high quality of some other methods. That said, some professionals or small business owners do successfully offer heat press printed shirts for sale.This method works great for at-home designers because of the easy setup and low start-up cost. It allows you to create complex designs or photos just as easily as you would on paper. You have to master graphic design software if you want to create original artwork, but you can also just use images you find online or photos you snapped on your cell phone!",

    details:
      "Sublimation printing is the best professional way to print on polyester material. However, it does not work on other kinds of fabric with all-natural fibers, like cotton. This cool but very costly method uses heat to turn dye into a gas that bonds with the fabric. Sublimation printing creates soft, permanent designs on synthetic materials like polyester. Because of the unique way the dye sticks to the fabric, it leaves the cloth feeling breathable instead of creating a thick coating on the material. This also means that sublimation designs wonâ€™t crack or peel.",

    details:
      "Stenciling is the most basic method you can use on t-shirts at home. You can cut out a stencil by hand or use a more advanced tool like a Cricut to electronically cut out digital designs. You then apply dye over the stencil, creating a logo or design on the shirt! Professionals often used more advanced forms of stenciling in methods such as screen printing. However, you can replicate this at home with really simple tools if you just want to make a few fun shirts for your family! The pros of stenciling are that you can make it as complex or simple as you want. Also, you do not need fancy technology or expensive equipment. though you usually get more permanent results if you heat set a fabric design in some way.",
